The current global average temperature is 0.85ºC higher than it was in the late 19th century. Each of the past three decades has been warmer than any preceding decade since records began in 1850.
The world's leading climate scientists think human activities are almost certainly the main cause of the warming observed since the middle of the 20th century.
Now the challenge is to develop a system that can reduce the increasing amount of global warming
SOLUTION: 
Most climate scientists agree the main cause of the current global warming trend is the increasing amount of greenhouse gas in the environment. We came with a simple solution that reduce huge amount of greenhouse gas from the environment. 
As we all know that majority percentage of greenhouse gas is produced by Industries & In industry Most of the case  they burn fuel to run boiler (e.g. Dyeing mill spinning mill  or  textile & garments mills ).
In our solution we proposed a new type of efficient boiler that use solar energy to run & doesn’t need any kind of fuel to be burnt . and the increasing  percentage of greenhouse gas will be reduced and our global warming will also reduced .
1.	Water level will be in a reasonable height
2.	Ice melting in out pole side will be saved
3.	Many of our land will be save from going under water
4.	Global warming will reduce
5.	Green house gases will decrease from air
